Diavgeia.org is a non-profit that builds better government and public sector interfaces. Our first project is [diavgeia.ai](https://diavgeia.ai), a better search engine for the 55 million acts published to the [greek Diavgeia program](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/divgeia-the-transparency-portal-publication-of-government-acts-and-decisions/).

## Our mission
* **A more understandable and accessible public sector for everyone:** The entire Greek state is *already digitized*: It is mainly located in the 55 million acts posted on Diavgeia. Every procurement,  law, tender, and hiring decision can be found in one of many millions of PDFs. All that's left to do is to build the technology that will make them easily accessible and understandable. In 2023, for the first time, this seems to be technologically feasible.
* **Reducing the technological gap between the public and private sectors:** Usually, the public sector is last to benefit from new technologies like AI. In a country like Greece, where the language of official documents is Greek, this gap can widen even further if AI models do not work well in Greek.
* **Open data and technologies for understanding the Greek language**, a valuable digital asset for the entire Greek economy.

## Our principles
* **Fast implementation**: Diavgeia.org, although an NGO, develops software at the pace of a tech startup. Our first project is [diavgeia.ai](https://diavgeia.ai/), a search engine for acts posted on the [Di@vgeia Program](https://diavgeia.gov.gr).
* **Transparency**: Transparency is our default. Our code, data, organization chart, finances, and roadmap are all public and freely available for any use (even for commercial purposes without attribution). Our [email](mailto:contact@diavgeia.org) and DMs on [twitter](https://twitter.com/diavgeia_org) are also always open to everyone.
* **Political independence**: Diavgeia belongs to everyone and will always be politically independent. We do not accept help from any political party, but the practical support of state institutions is always welcome. Everything we create is available at any time for use or integration into the public sector.
